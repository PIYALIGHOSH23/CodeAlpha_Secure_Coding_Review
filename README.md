Great 🙌 Since you said **yes**, I’ll keep the **detailed professional README** for your GitHub project.

Here’s the final **README.md** you can copy-paste directly into your repo:

# ReciPHP 🍲  

**ReciPHP** is a simple PHP-based recipe management web application. It allows users to browse, add, update, and delete recipes while practicing secure coding principles. This project was created as part of the **CodeAlpha Internship – Secure Coding Review Task**.  

## 🚀 Features  
- User authentication (login & registration)  
- Add, edit, delete, and view recipes  
- Search functionality for recipes  
- Secure database interactions (prepared statements, input validation)  
- Lightweight and easy to deploy

## 🔧 Installation & Setup  
1. Clone this repository:  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Marsellino-Nasry/CodeAlpha-Internship-Tasks.git
````

2. Navigate to the project folder:

   ```bash
   cd CodeAlpha-Internship-Tasks/CodeAlpha_Secure_Coding_Review-Task-3/ReciPHP
   ```
3. Import the SQL file into your database (if provided).
4. Update `config.php` with your database credentials.
5. Run the project on a local server (XAMPP, WAMP, or LAMP).

   Example for XAMPP:

   * Place the project inside `htdocs`
   * Start Apache & MySQL
   * Visit: `http://localhost/ReciPHP`

## 🔒 Security Best Practices Implemented

* **Prepared statements** to prevent SQL Injection
* **Password hashing** for secure authentication
* **Input sanitization & validation**
* **Session management** to prevent hijacking
* **File upload security** (restricting extensions & sanitizing names)

## 📌 Future Enhancements

* Role-based access control (Admin/User)
* API integration for recipe sharing
* Modern front-end with React or Vue.js
